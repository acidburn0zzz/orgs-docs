<p>The key to managing package access in an Organization is Teams.
<strong>Teams are sets of Organization Members that have defined privileges
for a set of packages that are controlled by the Organization</strong>.
This page will teach you how to create and manage the 
membership of your Organization&apos;s team from the web interface.</p>
<p>If you would like to manage the membership of your Team from
the npm command line interface (CLI), you can use:</p>
<pre><code>npm team
</code></pre><p>Learn more about <code>npm team</code> <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/team" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you are looking for how to manage a Team&apos;s Package Access, check
out <a href="managing-package-access.html">this doc</a>.</p>
<p>You will need to have the <strong>Owner</strong> or <strong>Admin</strong> Role to perform this
work. For more information on <strong>Roles</strong>, check out the 
<a href="roles-and-privileges.html">Roles and Privileges doc</a>.</p>
<hr>

<p>To manage your Organization&apos;s Teams, navigate to your
Organizations landing page. You can find it at
<code>https://www.npmjs.com/org/&lt;org_name&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Once you are on your Organization&apos;s landing page, click the &quot;Teams&quot; tab.
You can also just point your browser at 
<code>https://www.npmjs.com/org/&lt;org_name&gt;/teams</code>.</p>
